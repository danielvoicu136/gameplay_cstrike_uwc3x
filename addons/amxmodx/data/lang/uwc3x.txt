WAR3INFO6 = 3) Type bind = shopmenu2 (displays shopmenu2)
WAR3INFO7 = 4) Type bind p wcward (to use the serpant ward ability)
WAR3INFO8 = UWC3X allows you to have several ultimate skills as opposed to just one from the original Warcraft3. In the skills menu (/selectskill) ultimate skills will say (Ultimate: name), for example for the Teleport ultimate it says (Ultimate: wcteleport). Once you learn this skill you can use it by binding a key to the wcteleport command, done by typing: bind key wcteleport in the console.
WAR3INFO9 = Say <b>/commands</b> to see the list of UWC3X spoken commands and say <b>/help</b> for the UWC3X help menu.
